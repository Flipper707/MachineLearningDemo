# MachineLearningDemo
A demo to show scikit-learn to implement linear regression and classification.

## Files
The repo contains the following files:
- <code>regression.py</code> : a simple Linear regression model to predict the Salary of an employee based on the years of experience. It works with the 'Salary_Data.csv' file.
- <code>Salary_Data.csv</code> : the dataset used in the regression.py script.
- <code>classification.py</code> : a simple Random Forest Classification model to classify into one of the three flower species from the Iris public dataset
